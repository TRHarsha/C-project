# C/C++ -Project
Hi there! This is a collection of projects I have created using the C++ programming language.

# Project 1: Medical Data Base
This code is written in C++ and implements a simple patient management system. The system can add a new patient, search for a patient based on their phone number, edit patient information, delete a patient, and print all patient information. The patient information is stored in a structure named patient that contains the patient's name, blood group, phone number, age, and Adhaar number.The code includes various functions to implement the above mentioned functionality.

# Project 2: Calculator
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

# Usage
