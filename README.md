# C/C++ -Project
Hi there! This is a collection of projects I have created using the C++ programming language.

## Project 1: Medical Data Base
This code is written in C++ and implements a simple patient management system. The system can add a new patient, search for a patient based on their phone number, edit patient information, delete a patient, and print all patient information. The patient information is stored in a structure named patient that contains the patient's name, blood group, phone number, age, and Adhaar number.The code includes various functions to implement the above mentioned functionality.

## Project 2: Solving Laplace equation in 2D using Finite difference Method
This code calculates the unknown values inside a 5 x 5 square mesh given the boundary values. It uses a numerical method called finite difference method to solve for the unknown values. The method involves approximating the solution to the Laplace equation by discretizing the domain into smaller sub-regions, and then updating the solution in each iteration by taking the average of the known values around it. The code takes the boundary values as inputs and calculates the values inside the square using the formula given in the code. The unknown values are then stored in the "matrix" array.

### Usage
To run these projects, you need to have a C/C++ compiler installed on your machine. Simply clone or download this repository, open the project's source code in your compiler and run the code.

### Contributions
If you would like to contribute to these projects, feel free to create a pull request with your changes. I am always open to suggestions and improvements.
